This set consists of mainly older Slater-Koster files with a focus on
solid state systems [SiO,SiC]. The parameters might also
be applicable for organic systems, but one usually would only expect a
more qualitative accuracy. So use the "bio" set instead for bio molecules.

The silicon parameters are good for silicon clusters (using a sp basis
only) [Silicon], while the same parameters with d-orbitals on Si are
used for silica.

The fluorine parameters have been validated especially
concerning the relative energetics of SiF_x and CF_x [Fluorine].

The iron parameters have been applied to structural and magnetic
properties of iron clusters [Iron], but should also give reasonable
results for bcc bulk iron.
